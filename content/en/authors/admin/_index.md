Molecular biologist, bioinformatician

{{< icon name="graduation-cap" pack="fas" >}} Hello, there! I’m Thyago. I’m a molecular biologist passionate about cutting-edge research, programming and biostatistics! I’m a strong advocate for open(science, data, source), and reproducible research. My main goal is to use molecular biology and computational/statistical tools to understand biological phenomena and translate these into human health. During my graduation I worked mainly with transcriptomics, genomics and molecular biology, both wet and dry benches. Currently, I'm working on CRISPR-based epigenetic reprogramming for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

{{< icon name="file-code" pack="fas" >}} My most frequently used programming languages are R (stats, data wrangling, data viz.), Python (snakemake pipelines, automation, machine learning) and Bash/Zsh (automation, linux management). I’m also beginner with C++ and Rust.

{{< icon name="tree" pack="fas" >}} In my free time I enjoy reading, meditating, painting, hiking, music, pets, and learning new stuff.
