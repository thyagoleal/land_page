Cas9 has greatly revolutionized the field of gene editing because of its versatility and ease of use.
Even though it has matured to the point of receiving FDA approval, Cas9-based gene therapies are hampered mostly because of Cas9's size, immunogenicity, and specific sgRNA constraints.
Since it's description, CRISPR/Cas9 has propelled the field of gene editing in a way only imagined when TALENs and zinc-finger nucleases were the only options.

Cas9 is a very efficient and easy to control RNA-guided endonuclease.
Derived from bacteria, this protein has been repurposed as the main gene editing platform currently used in basic research and gene therapy applications.
Despite its attributes, Cas9 size (around 1360 aminoacids or 4.1 kb) hinders its delivery with traditional AAV vectors and other non-viral delivery methods (e.g. mRNA via LNPs).
While size is the main limitation, Cas9 bacterial origin makes it immunogenical.

Given these limitations, alternative Cas proteins have been identified or engineered to facilitate delivery without loosing specificity.
For example Cas12a, Cas12f (Cas14), Cas12e (CasX), Cas12j (CasΦ), all smaller than SpCas9, some reachibg close to 400 aminoacids.
While similar, many of them differ in how they target the DNA and with varying specificities.
However, this is a fast-evolving field with optimized recombinant enzymes being released all the time.

Still motivated by the size, other systems have been discovered other than Cas.
Among these, the IscB (Cas9-like OrfB) and TpnB, ancestors of Cas9 and Cas12, respectively, have been found in archaea and other bacteria.
They are smaller and have been optimized as gene editing tool, albeit with varying efficiencies and specificities because of their distinct nuclease domains and DNA binding mechanisms.

What about eukaryotes? Feng Zhang's group has described an eukaryotic RNA-guided nuclease termed Fanzor.
This protein is guided by an OMEGA RNA and is small and highly programmable.
As of now, the nuclease activity is suboptimal compared to other small Cas and IscB and TpnB nucleases.
However, given its eurkaryotic origins, it could be that newer optimized versions would make them good gene editors in vivo, probably by lower immunogenicity.

Another recent discovery is the TIGR-Tas system composed of the small (around 330 aminoacids) Tas nuclease.
It uses a novel dual-spacer guide RNA (tigRNA) to target DNA without requiring a PAM sequence.
As of now, the editing efficiency is small, the highest being 0.8%, requiring engineering optimizations if is to replace the other options for gene editing.

Finally, the most recent discoveries are the hybrid CRISPR and other proteins capable of genome editing, such as ISCro4 recombinase, CAST system (CRISPR- associated transposas), bridge recombinases, bBxb1,
