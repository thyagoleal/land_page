        During my undergraduation, I rotated through microbiology (Dr. Jupyracyara C. Barros), biochemistry (Dr. Geraldo L. Sadoyama) and molecular biology (Dr. Adriana F. Neves) labs, where I developed skills such as bacterial and eukaryote cell culture, nucleic acids molecular biology, SELEX for aptamer identification, molecular cloning, antimicrobial compound identification and evaluation.
        
  - title: Graduate Researcher (Masters)
    company: Fiocruz/IOC/LAHAN
    company_url: ''
    location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
    date_start: '2016-07-01'
    date_end: '2018-07-16'

        For my master's dissertation I worked with microarray datasets for identifying common biological modulated pathways in leprosy. During this time, most of my bioinformatics skills were consolidated, especially -omics data analysis, scripting, design of experiments and data viz. I also spent some time in professor's Stewart Cole’s Lab, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland, where I worked with RNA sequencing and had some experience in a BSL-3 lab.

  - title: Graduate Researcher (PhD)
    company: Fiocruz/IOC/LAHAN

    location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        In my PhD I apply transcriptomics (RNA sequencing) and mol. bio. to identify biomarkers and novel biological pathways behind leprosy immunopathogenesis, focusing on translational applications. I also had the opportunity to work with genomics bioinformatics, such as targeted-exome sequencing, small-medium scale genotyping and QTL mapping, thanks to internal and external collaborations. In parallel, I work upon improving my coding skills, experiment design, learning about the most relevant database systems and reproducible research techniques/tools.
